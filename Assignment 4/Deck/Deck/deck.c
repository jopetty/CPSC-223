/**
 Implementation of a deck of cards as a linked list.
 
 Should be created either with `_deckCreateEmptyDeck()` when an uninitialized
 deck is needed, or with `deckCreate()` to create a full 52 card deck. `deckCreate()`
 is the only public way to create a deck. By default, the deck is ordered first by
 suit, then by rank.
 
 Deck is implemented as a doubly linked list to allow for O(1) insertion at the end
 and for O(1) deletion at the beginning. Being doubly linked also allows for destruction
 in O(n) time, rather than O(n!) time.
 
 - Parameters:
 	- length:	How many cards are in the deck. Should never be set externally.
 	- first:	Pointer to the first node in the deck.
 	- last:		Pointer to the last node in the deck.
