/**
 A vertex in a directed graph. All
 connected vertices have a string whose
 length is strictly less than the partent
 vertex.
 
 @param isValidPath	Boolean flag. @c true indicates
 that there is a path to a vertex whose string
 is of length one; false indicates the opposite.
 
 @param string	A string which is used to build all
 descendent vertices.
 
 @param size	The number of connections from this
 vertex to others. Since this graph is directed,
 this property is not a equivalence relation.
 
 @param connections	An array of length @c size whose
 members are vertices built from the string of
 this vertex.

 Builds a directed graph from the input string, whose vertices

 from this vertex will have substrings built from this.
